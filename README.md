## These are the Shell and R scripts I use in my analysis and research on small-RNA sequencing data.  
They cover tasks such as ***raw data quality control***, ***optimization of QC parameters***, ***data organization***, ***statistical analysis***, and ***figure generation***.  
The packages, pipelines and programs I use include but are not limited to:  
[***fastqc***](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), [***fastp***](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp), [***multiqc***](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC), [***sports1.1***](https://github.com/junchaoshi/sports1.1), [***DESeq2***](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html), etc.
